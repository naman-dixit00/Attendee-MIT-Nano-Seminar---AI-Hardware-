MIT Nano Seminar: Neuromorphic Computing via Integration of Diffusive and Drift Memristors
---
ABSTRACT
Memristors can be broadly categorized into diffusive and drift types, distinguished by their reset switching mechanisms. Diffusive memristors reset through spontaneous ion diffusion under zero bias, exhibiting dynamics that closely resemble biological ionic processes, making them particularly attractive for processing temporal information. Drift memristors, in contrast, rely on electric-field-driven ion migration, offering highly stable and tunable analog resistance states that are well suited for storing long-term information. The synergistic integration of diffusive and drift memristors enables the design of compact, energy-efficient, and biorealistic neuromorphic hardware. This talk will present recent progress in device engineering, array-level integration, and application demonstrations, highlighting their potential to advance next-generation computing hardware for machine learning and artificial intelligence.
