## Neuromorphic Computing via Integration of Diffusive and Drift Memristors

---

### **Abstract**

Memristors can be broadly categorized into **diffusive and drift types**, distinguished by their reset switching mechanisms:

* **Diffusive Memristors:** Reset through spontaneous ion diffusion under zero bias. Their dynamics closely resemble biological ionic processes, making them particularly attractive for processing **temporal information**.
* **Drift Memristors:** Rely on electric-field-driven ion migration. They offer highly stable and tunable analog resistance states, well-suited for storing **long-term information**.

The **synergistic integration** of these two types enables the design of compact, energy-efficient, and biorealistic neuromorphic hardware. This talk will cover:

1. Recent progress in device engineering.
2. Array-level integration.
3. Application demonstrations for next-generation machine learning and AI hardware.
